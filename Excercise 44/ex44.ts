//Q44:Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.

function createCar(Manufacturer: string, Model: string, ...properties: [string,any][]) : any {
    const car: any = {
        Manufacturer,
        Model,
    };
    
    for (const [key,value] of properties) [

        car[key] = value
    ]
    return car;
}

const cars: string = createCar("Honda", "Civic", ["Color", "White"],["Transmission", "Automatic"]);

console.log(cars)
